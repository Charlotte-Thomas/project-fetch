# Project-2: Fetch

## Overview
Link to the site on [GitHub Pages](https://charlotte-thomas.github.io/project-fetch/)

The second project tasked to us by General Assembly required us to develop a simple front-end application which incorporated a public API in which to make GET requests from. 

This was a **48 hour - paired-programming hackathon** with [Georg Preuss](https://github.com/georgpreuss)

My partner and I chose to use an API which gave us information about different dog breeds. We took turns to either write the code or direct the person programming.

## Brief

* Consume a public API
* Have several components - At least one classical and one functional
* The app should include a router - with several "pages"
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## Technologies Used

> JavaScript (ES6)   
> React.js (using classes)       
> HTML5       
> SCSS   
> TheDogApi  
> Bulma  
> Git  
> GitHub

## Approach

Due to the limited time-frame given to complete this project, we decided to create a very simple site which had a landing-page, list of breeds, single dog page and favourites page.
